### Description

This project implements the Huffman Coding Tree algorithm, which is often used for data compression. By assigning shorter binary codes to commonly used characters and longer codes to less common ones, the technique minimizes data size and improves storage and transmission efficiency.



### Getting Started

*Dependencies*  
To successfully run this project, ensure you have the following:
- *Python* (preferably version 3.x) to support code execution
- Compatible OS: Windows 10, Linux, or macOS
- *Google Colab* access, for cloud-based execution if preferred



### Installing

1. *Download*: For quick access, open the provided Google Colab link (see “Executing Program”).
2. *Local Setup*: If running locally, download or clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone <insert-your-repo-link>
   
3. *File Preparation*: Verify that the input data (character-frequency pairs) is correctly formatted, as outlined in the instructions.



### Executing the Program

*Colab Link*: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H_KoeUjKJhNmn-Kz60fOUvgP50mfxsKG#scrollTo=aM_w4pBT1y6k&line=72&uniqifier=1]

*Steps to Run*:
1. Open the provided Colab link.
2. Upload the code file or paste the code directly into the Colab notebook.
3. Execute each cell in sequence:
   - Input character-frequency data as prompted.
   - Run the cell to build the Huffman Tree.
   - Display the Huffman Codes for each character
